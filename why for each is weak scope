/* WHY WE CALLED FOR EACH A WEAK SCOPE */

/* Example 1 */
for each Order no-lock:
end.
disp Order.orderNum.
/* 
In Example 1 it will give us an error - ** No Order record is available. (91). So why we called for each a weak scope as it is not allowing us to access the records outside of for each loop 
*/
/* Below are the 2 examples where Order records is accesible outside of for each loop 
*/

/* Example 2 */
for each Order no-lock:
leave.
end.
disp orderNum.

/* Example 3 */
for each Order no-lock break by OrderNum:
disp orderNum.
end.
disp "Outside Scope" orderNum.
